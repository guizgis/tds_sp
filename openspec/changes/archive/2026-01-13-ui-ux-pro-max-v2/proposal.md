# Proposal: UI/UX Pro Max V2 - Glassmorphism & High-End UX

## Why
Iteration 1 provided a solid foundation, but the visual impact needs to be more "Flagship" to truly convey the premium nature of the TDS platform.

## What
Implement **Glassmorphism** across core components and layout. Introduce micro-animations and Bento-box grid layouts for better data visualization.

## Expected Outcome
A stunning, modern interface that rivals top-tier B2B SaaS platforms while maintaining strict compliance with NDI standards.
